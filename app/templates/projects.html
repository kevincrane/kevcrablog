  <h3>Projects</h3>
  <h5>To be added later!</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Anything web dev-y that I want to show off (basically nothing so far because web development
      is boring and I'm not an artist)
    </li>
    <li>
      Links to code or demos for really cool back-end projects. This is the real shit because you have real
      flexibility and creativity for making something awesome and fun. It's just not usually good for normal people.
    </li>
  </ul>
